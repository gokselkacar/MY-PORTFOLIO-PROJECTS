## Customer Segmentation and Targeted Marketing Strategy

### Objective
Developing a customer segmentation model to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and personal characteristics. Using this model to recommend targeted marketing strategies for a retail company.

### Steps
#### Data Exploration:
- Import the dataset and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- Check for missing values, outliers, and understand the distribution of key
variables like age, income, and spending score.

#### Data Preprocessing:
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.

- Normalize the data.

#### Customer Segmentation:
- Use the K-means algorithm to segment customers into groups.

- Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow
method.

- Analyze the characteristics of each cluster.

#### Data Visualization:
- Visualize the clusters using scatter plots, highlighting different segments
with distinct colors.

- Use bar charts or pie charts to show the distribution of categorical
variables like gender within each cluster.

#### Insights and Strategy Formulation:
- Derive insights from the clustering results.

- Recommend targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment.
